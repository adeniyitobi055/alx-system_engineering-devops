## 0x05. Processes and signals

This project is focused on the following:
- A PID
- A process
- How to find a process' PID
- How to kill a process
- Signal- 2 signals that cannot be ignored

#### PID
A process identifier (PID) is a number used by most operating system kernels such as those of Unix, macOS and Windows to uniquely identify an active process.

#### SIGNALS
A signal is an electrical or electromagnetic current that is used for carrying data from one device or network to another.

There are signals that cannot be ignored. SIGKILL always kills a process without giving it a chance of reacting. SIGSTOP always suspends a process without giving it a chance of reacting.
